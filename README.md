second project - we made a trigonometry calculator without using the math library

didn't realize round wasn't in the math library, made our own for no reason

mostly coded individually instead of peer programming

for inverse functions, series had high error when input approaches 1, we used linear approximation to get the answer closer, but the error is still about 1% at maximum
this is a problem for math majors to solve, we are just gonna leave it as it is now
